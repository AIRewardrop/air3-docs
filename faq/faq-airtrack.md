# AIRTrack FAQ

## What is AIRTrack?

AIRTrack is the live tracking, simulation, and strategy validation layer of the AIR3 ecosystem.

## Does AIRTrack execute real trades?

No. AIRTrack is not a real trade execution product. It tracks and simulates strategy behavior, positions, and outcomes for transparency and validation purposes.

## Why is AIRTrack important if it does not execute trades?

AIRTrack provides public visibility into how strategies behave under live market conditions before they are promoted to AIRTrading. It acts as a validation layer, not a replacement for execution.

## How are strategies moved from AIRTrack to AIRTrading?

The workflow is:
1. Strategy idea or rule set is defined
2. Strategy is observed and tested live on AIRTrack
3. Results are reviewed (PnL behavior, risk behavior, execution assumptions)
4. Only strategies that pass validation are promoted to AIRTrading

## What kind of data does AIRTrack show?

AIRTrack can show simulated positions, entries, exits, PnL evolution, and strategy monitoring outputs generated from AIR3 trade logic and social-driven signals.

## Is AIRTrack performance the same as AIRTrading performance?

Not necessarily. AIRTrack is a validation layer. Real execution includes live fills, fees, slippage, and execution timing conditions that may differ from simulated tracking results.
