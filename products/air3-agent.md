# AIR3 Agent

AIR3 is the flagship public agent of the AIRewardrop ecosystem and the narrative center for AIR3 token utility.

## What AIR3 does

AIR3 combines:
- a 24/7 live MetaHuman interface
- real-time market and on-chain analytics
- social trend and sentiment reading
- autonomous posting and interaction
- a tokenized product ecosystem that extends beyond chat responses

## Operating surfaces

AIR3 is designed to operate across:
- X
- Twitch
- YouTube
- Telegram
- Discord
- AIRdApp (product portal)

## Command style and data-driven outputs

AIR3 supports prompt/command patterns such as:
- chart by ticker / contract
- price lookup
- analysis
- sentiment
- news
- trend/mention signals

See [User Commands (AIR3 Engine)](../resources/command-manual.md).

## Product role in the ecosystem

AIR3 is both:
1. the public interface users see and interact with, and
2. the utility anchor for downstream modules (AIRTrack, AIRTrading, AIRTool, AIRSponsor, AIRSocial)

## Design principle

AIR3 is positioned as a "data becomes action" interface:
- verifiable analytics first
- transparent tracking before execution
- execution only after live strategy validation
