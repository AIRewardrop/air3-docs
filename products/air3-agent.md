# AIR3 Agent

AIR3 Agent is the public-facing AI agent of the AIRewardrop ecosystem.

It operates across social and community channels and acts as the communication layer for market commentary, trade-related updates, community interaction, and product discovery.

## What users see

* Market-oriented content and updates
* Community interaction in official channels
* Live presence through streaming integrations
* Trade-related posts and confirmations linked to AIR products

## Role in the ecosystem

AIR3 Agent is the interface layer that connects users to the broader AIR stack:

* AIRTrack for live strategy tracking and simulation outputs
* AIRTrading for execution-related visibility and protocol communication
* AIRSocial, AIRSponsor, and AIRTool for ecosystem utility flows

## Trade traceability on social channels

Trade transparency includes a social layer in addition to app and protocol visibility.

At a high level:

* a trade announcement is published on X when a trade opens
* a trade confirmation card is published when the trade closes, including realized PnL
* users can cross-reference activity in AIRdApp / AIRTrack where applicable

This structure makes trade communication easier to follow for both community users and external observers.
