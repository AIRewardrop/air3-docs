# AIRSocial

AIRSocal (AIRSocial in the UI) is the community activity and reward layer inside AIRdApp.

## Purpose

AIRSocial is designed to:
- reward community participation
- support campaigns and missions
- create engagement loops tied to the AIR ecosystem
- prepare future on-chain / wallet-connected social incentive mechanics

## Visible UI components (current/coming soon)

Based on the current AIRdApp UI, AIRSocial includes:
- leaderboard sections (Telegram / Gleam / Wallet)
- points-based ranking
- social missions (coming soon)
- referral link area (coming soon)
- connected profile context

## Product role in the stack

AIRSocial complements AIR3 and AIRdApp by tracking non-trading engagement:
- community actions
- campaign participation
- mission completions
- potentially future utility unlocks and rewards

## Notes

AIRSocial is distinct from AIRTrack and AIRTrading:
- AIRSocial measures community activity
- AIRTrack measures simulated strategy performance
- AIRTrading executes strategies with vault logic
