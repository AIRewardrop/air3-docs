# AIRTool

AIRTool is the community deployment / rental layer for the AIR3 text agent.

## Default availability

The AIR3 text agent is available by default only in the official AIR3 Discord and Telegram communities.

## Third-party community access

Projects can rent the AIR3 agent for their own Discord and/or Telegram communities through a buy + burn combo that unlocks the AIR3 agent feature set.

This allows projects to bring AIR3-style intelligence into their own communities without building the full infrastructure stack.

## AIRTool scope (as shown in UI)

The UI describes deployment constraints and onboarding requirements, including:
- Telegram public or private group targeting
- Discord deployment scope limitations
- project requirement submission
- burn verification
- onboarding / activation process
- email activation procedure

## AIRTool feature intent

AIRTool is positioned for communities that want:
- community support responses
- market alerts and signals
- on-chain insight summaries
- a branded, operational AI presence in their channels

- burn AIR3
- unlock agent deployment time/access
