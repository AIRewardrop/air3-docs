# Products Overview

AIR3 docs now cover a full multi-product stack. The products share the same ecosystem narrative and AIR3 token utility, but they serve different roles.

## Product map

### AIR3 Agent (public-facing)
The flagship AI agent and live MetaHuman interface:
- 24/7 live presence
- chart / price / analysis / sentiment style commands
- autonomous content and community engagement
- gateway into the AIR ecosystem

### AIRTrack (tracking and simulation)
AIRTrack is a **live testing and transparency layer**, not an execution venue:
- simulates positions from AIR3 signals/posts
- tracks active, pending, and closed trades
- records realized/unrealized PnL
- tests rule-based risk management (TP/SL adjustment logic)
- provides sharable evidence of strategy behavior

### AIRTrading (execution)
AIRTrading is the **real execution vault layer**:
- strategy execution on Pacifica perpetuals
- vault accounting and user shares
- withdrawal requests with delayed payout
- season/epoch profit settlement
- AIR3 buyback + user rewards logic

Only strategies that prove themselves in live AIRTrack testing should be promoted to AIRTrading execution.

### AIRSocial
Community activity and reward layer:
- leaderboard
- missions
- points
- campaign mechanics
- future referral / social participation expansion

### AIRSponsor
Buy + burn sponsor slot system:
- projects acquire visibility in AIR3 live content
- brand appears on screen
- AIR3 can deliver a scripted spoken sponsor call-out
- designed as a utility + burn mechanism

### AIRTool
AIR3 agent rental for external communities:
- AIR3 text agent is included by default only in official AIR3 Telegram/Discord communities
- third-party projects can rent AIR3 for their own Telegram/Discord
- unlocks the AIR3 agent feature set for their community via buy + burn combo
