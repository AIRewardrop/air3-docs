# AIR3 Agent FAQ

## What is the AIR3 Agent?

The AIR3 Agent is the public-facing AI agent experience within the AIRewardrop ecosystem. It powers community interaction, market commentary, and product-facing workflows across official channels and selected integrations.

## Where is the AIR3 text agent available by default?

The AIR3 text agent is available by default in the official AIR3 community channels (Discord and Telegram). Availability and features may differ between official channels and partner deployments.

## What is AIRTool?

AIRTool is the product flow that allows projects to request AIR3 agent deployment for their own Telegram and/or Discord communities through a buy-and-burn access model. It is designed for community support and market alert use cases using the AIR3 agent feature set.

## What is AIRSponsor?

## What is AIRSocial?

AIRSocial is the social participation and campaign layer within AIRdApp. It is designed for community engagement, missions, and points-based participation experiences tied to the AIR3 ecosystem.

## Does AIRSponsor guarantee performance or market results?

No. AIRSponsor is a visibility and communication product. It is not a guarantee of market performance, user acquisition, or token price outcomes.

## What does the buy-and-burn model do in these products?

The buy-and-burn model is used as an access and utility mechanism in selected AIR3 products (such as AIRSponsor and AIRTool). Specific requirements, thresholds, and activation procedures are product-defined and may be updated operationally.
