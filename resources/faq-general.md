# General FAQ

## What is AIR3?

AIR3 is the AIRewardrop ecosystem centered on the AIR3 token, AI-driven products, and public verification surfaces. It includes AIRdApp interfaces, AIRTrack (tracking and simulation), AIRTrading (execution layer), and additional community and utility products such as AIRSocial, AIRSponsor, and AIRTool.

## What is the difference between AIRTrack and AIRTrading?

AIRTrack is a live tracking, simulation, and strategy validation layer. It is used to monitor strategy behavior in live market conditions and document results, but it does not execute real user trades.

AIRTrading is the real execution environment. Strategies are considered for deployment only after they have been tested and validated through live observation on AIRTrack.

## Where can I verify AIR3 activity publicly?

AIR3 uses a layered transparency model:
- AIRdApp and AIRTrack interfaces for strategy tracking and trade history views
- Social trade traceability on X via [@AIRewardrop](https://x.com/AIRewardrop), including trade open announcements and trade close cards with realized PnL
- On-chain accounting and protocol events where applicable to the product flow

## Is AIR3 only a trading product?

No. AIR3 is a broader ecosystem. In addition to strategy tracking and execution products, the ecosystem also includes social/community features and utility products such as AIRSocial, AIRSponsor, and AIRTool.

## Where are the official AIR3 links?

See [Official Links](official-links.md) for websites, social channels, and documentation entry points.

## Does the documentation describe every implementation detail?

The documentation describes the operating model, user-facing behavior, and protocol logic. Some technical parameters and implementation specifics may be configurable and can evolve with deployments and operational updates.
