# Roadmap 2025-2027

This page consolidates the public AIRewardrop roadmap with AIR3 docs clarifications for the current product stack.

## Roadmap framing

AIRewardrop positions itself as "Autonomous Agent Infrastructure for Crypto", with AIR3 as the flagship public agent and utility hub.

The roadmap is published in phases, with continuous workstreams that run across all phases.

## Phase 2 - Productization & Expansion (Q4 2025)

Goal: transition AIR3 from showcase to a full multi-service product.

Published roadmap highlights include:
- **AIRtrak (Web App)**: verifiable trading module showing open/closed positions, unrealized PnL, equity curve, and trading stats (win rate, total trades, PnL, etc.)
- **Private dApp Portal (Beta)**: wallet connect, profile, staking vaults, service menu, and credits for premium features
- **Community Agent Deployment**: framework for launching custom agents in Discord/Telegram via locked AIR3 (example shown publicly: 100,000 AIR3 for 180 days = 6 months access)
- **Voice & Live Monetization**: AIR3 payments for voice spots, shoutouts, automated reports, scheduled posts
- **B2B White-Label Program**: custom text/MetaHuman agent delivery for partners

## Phase 3 - Agent Swarm & Ecosystem Growth (Q5 2025)

Goal: build a distributed ecosystem of interoperable agents.

Published highlights:
- **Agent Swarm Framework** across AIR3, PolarAI, LAIR, and future agents
- **New Chain Expansions** (including PolarAI / LAIR, plus Base and Avalanche listed as next in line)
- **Plugin & Template Marketplace (Agent Studio)**
- **Staking Vault Launch** with tiered staking benefits and trading-profit redistribution direction
- **API & Partner Toolkit** for integrating agent data into external apps/dashboards

## Phase 4 - Consolidation & Commercialization (Q1-Q2 2026)

Goal: scale infrastructure and create sustainable value for AIR3.

Published highlights:
- **Full AIR3 dApp Rollout** with unified modules (AIRtrak + Vault + Portal + Marketplace + Companion Instances)
- **Companion Agents (One-to-One)** with dedicated memory/personality and premium portfolio/risk features
- **Autotrading Engine (Testnet)** based on AIR3 trade signals, transparent through AIRtrak
- **Corporate & B2B Expansion** under the AIRewardrop white-label framework
- **Public API Monetization** with usage-based plans

## Phase 5 - Governance & Decentralization (Late 2026 -> 2027)

Goal: gradual handover of governance and value distribution to community and partners.

Published highlights:
- **Governance Layer** (on-chain voting for treasury, roadmap, design choices)
- **Automated Treasury Operations** tied to real dApp/licensing revenue
- **Agent DAO Model**
- **Open SDK** for external builders

## Always-On Tracks (published)

The roadmap also lists continuous workstreams:
- local LLM and inference optimization
- MetaHuman / Unreal Engine upgrades
- partner and chain integrations
- legal setup and compliance (Panama registration)
- marketing and social expansion (X, Twitch, YouTube, Telegram, Discord)
- support for partner agents (PolarAI, LAIR, XRPL, and upcoming agents)

## AIR3 Docs v2 clarifications added here

This docs update adds product and protocol clarity that users need right now:

### AIRTrack vs AIRTrading separation (critical)
- **AIRTrack = live tracking/simulation and strategy testing**
- **AIRTrading = real execution**
- only strategies that pass live AIRTrack testing should be promoted to AIRTrading execution

### AIRTrading protocol logic (design documentation)
- single vault model
- pro-rata exits across all open positions
- 7-day delayed payout with immediate PnL exclusion
- current-epoch exclusion (anti double-pay)
- epoch-based realized PnL settlement
- 50/50 buyback vs users split after fee (where applicable)
