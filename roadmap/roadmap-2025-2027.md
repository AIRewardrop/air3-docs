# Roadmap 2025-2027

This roadmap page consolidates publicly communicated AIRewardrop milestones and aligns them with the current AIR3 documentation structure. It is intended to help users, partners, and prospective participants understand how the product stack is evolving and how the modules connect.

## Strategic position

AIRewardrop is building autonomous agent infrastructure for crypto, with AIR3 as the flagship public-facing agent and product hub. The roadmap is organized in phases, while several infrastructure and ecosystem workstreams continue in parallel.

## Product architecture at a glance

The AIR3 stack is documented as a connected system of products:

- **AIRdApp**: the user-facing portal and access layer
- **AIRTrack**: live tracking, simulation, and strategy validation
- **AIRTrading**: real execution environment for strategies that pass live validation
- **AIRSocial**: community missions, points, and engagement layer
- **AIRSponsor**: buy-and-burn sponsored visibility in AIR3 live channels
- **AIRTool**: AIR3 agent rental / deployment flow for partner communities

This separation is important for user clarity and risk transparency, especially between AIRTrack (testing/tracking) and AIRTrading (execution).

## Phase 2 - Productization and Expansion (Q4 2025)

**Objective:** move AIR3 from a public showcase agent toward a multi-module product ecosystem.

Public roadmap highlights:

- **AIRtrak (Web App):** verifiable trading interface with open/closed positions, unrealized PnL, equity curve, and performance statistics (win rate, total trades, realized PnL, and related metrics)
- **Private dApp Portal (Beta):** wallet connect, profile, vault and service access, and premium feature gating
- **Community Agent Deployment:** framework for custom AIR3-powered agents in Discord and Telegram, using AIR3-based access mechanics
- **Voice and Live Monetization:** AIR3-powered voice spots, shout-outs, scheduled reports, and live content placements
- **B2B White-Label Program:** custom text/MetaHuman agent delivery for partners

## Phase 3 - Agent Swarm and Ecosystem Growth (Q5 2025)

**Objective:** expand from a single flagship agent into a coordinated ecosystem of interoperable agents.

Public roadmap highlights:

- **Agent Swarm Framework** spanning AIR3, PolarAI, LAIR, and future agents
- **Chain Expansion** roadmap including Base and Avalanche, in addition to ongoing ecosystem extensions
- **Plugin and Template Marketplace (Agent Studio)**
- **Staking Vault Expansion** with tiered utility and redistribution-oriented mechanics
- **API and Partner Toolkit** for external dashboards, products, and integrations

## Phase 4 - Consolidation and Commercialization (Q1-Q2 2026)

**Objective:** scale infrastructure, unify modules, and improve monetization quality across products and partnerships.

Public roadmap highlights:

- **Full AIR3 dApp Rollout** with a unified interface across tracking, vault, portal, and service modules
- **Companion Agents (One-to-One)** with dedicated memory/personality and premium features
- **Autotrading Engine (Testnet)** with transparent monitoring through AIRTrack
- **Corporate and B2B Expansion** under the AIRewardrop white-label framework
- **Public API Monetization** with usage-based plans

## Phase 5 - Governance and Decentralization (Late 2026 -> 2027)

**Objective:** progressively expand community and partner participation in governance and treasury-related decisions.

Public roadmap highlights:

- **Governance Layer** for treasury, roadmap, and design decisions
- **Automated Treasury Operations** tied to real dApp and licensing revenue
- **Agent DAO Model**
- **Open SDK** for external builders and partners

## Continuous execution tracks

The public roadmap also indicates ongoing workstreams that support all phases:

- local LLM and inference optimization
- MetaHuman / Unreal Engine upgrades
- partner and chain integrations
- legal setup and compliance
- marketing and social expansion (X, Twitch, YouTube, Telegram, Discord)
- support for partner agents and ecosystem deployments

## Documentation clarifications included in this release

### AIRTrack and AIRTrading are distinct layers

- **AIRTrack** is the live tracking, simulation, and strategy validation layer
- **AIRTrading** is the real execution layer
- Strategies are expected to follow the documented flow: **strategy design -> live validation on AIRTrack -> promotion to AIRTrading after passing live tests**

### AIRTrading protocol documentation now includes

- single-vault accounting model
- pro-rata exits across all open positions
- 7-day delayed settlement with immediate PnL exclusion
- current-epoch exclusion to prevent double counting
- epoch-based realized PnL settlement
- AIR3 profit split logic (buyback / users) where applicable
