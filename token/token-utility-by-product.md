# AIR3 Token Utility by Product

This page summarizes how AIR3 utility connects to each product area in the ecosystem.

## AIR3 Agent
- token-linked access and service mechanics (depending on channel/product configuration)
- community and feature-level utility pathways
- interaction-driven ecosystem usage

## AIRTool
- buy-and-burn activation model for deploying the AIR3 text agent in third-party Discord and Telegram communities
- utility tied to B2B/community service access

## AIRSponsor
- buy-and-burn model for sponsored visibility slots during AIR3 live coverage
- scripted call-out and on-screen brand placement utility

## AIRSocial
- campaign, engagement, and mission-related utility pathways
- can support points, unlocks, or reward-linked mechanics depending on implementation

## AIRTrack
AIRTrack is a tracking and simulation product. It improves transparency and strategy validation, but it is not a real trade execution product and is not itself the execution source of protocol PnL.

## AIRTrading
AIRTrading is the real execution layer. It can generate protocol-level PnL and support token-linked flows through buyback and user reward mechanisms as defined by protocol rules.

## Important distinction

Strategy workflow:
**idea / strategy -> live validation on AIRTrack -> promotion to AIRTrading only after passing live tests**
