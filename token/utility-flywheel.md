# AIR3 Utility Flywheel

AIR3 token utility is tied to product usage, protocol economics, and ecosystem access.

The design objective is to connect real product actions to token demand and distribution flows in a transparent and understandable way.

## Core utility flows

### 1) AIRTrading protocol profit distribution (when applicable)

At epoch settlement, positive net profit (after fees) can be converted into AIR3 and split:

- **50% Buyback**
- **50% Users**

This links protocol performance to both treasury-side buyback activity and user reward allocation.

### 2) AIRSponsor buy-and-burn access

Projects can use a buy-and-burn flow to unlock sponsor slots in AIR3 live segments, where the project brand appears on-screen and AIR3 delivers a scripted call-out.

### 3) AIRTool buy-and-burn access

Projects can use a buy-and-burn flow to rent the AIR3 text agent for their own Discord and/or Telegram communities, unlocking the AIR3 agent feature set for a defined access window.

### 4) Ecosystem utility expansion

AIRSocial and other AIR ecosystem modules extend AIR3 utility into community participation, missions, and future module-based access mechanics.

## Why the flywheel matters

The AIR3 utility model is designed to connect:
- product usage
- protocol settlement outputs
- community engagement
- treasury and user reward flows

This creates a unified utility framework rather than a token model detached from product activity.
