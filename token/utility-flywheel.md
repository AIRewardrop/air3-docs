# AIR3 Utility Flywheel

AIR3 utility is designed to connect real product usage, protocol flows, and ecosystem services.

The goal is to build a transparent value loop where utility is linked to actual actions across the AIR3 ecosystem rather than isolated token mechanics.

## Utility layers

### 1. Protocol-linked flows (AIRTrading)
When applicable and after fees, positive Epoch PnL can be settled and routed according to protocol rules, including:
- AIR3 buyback allocation
- user allocation via protocol reward logic

See:
- [Rewards and Buyback](../protocol/rewards-and-buyback.md)
- [Season and Epoch Accounting](../protocol/seasons-and-epochs.md)

### 2. Product utility (AIR3 Agent ecosystem)
AIR3 utility is also tied to access and service modules, including:
- AIRTool (agent rental for Discord/Telegram communities)
- AIRSponsor (visibility slots and scripted live call-outs)
- AIRSocial (campaign and engagement-related utility pathways)

### 3. Ecosystem and partner services
AIR3 can be integrated into broader AIRewardrop product services and partner-facing deployments depending on product design and commercial structure.

## Design principle

The utility model prioritizes:
- product-linked demand
- transparent routing rules
- public traceability
- operational clarity across modules
