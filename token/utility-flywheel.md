# AIR3 Utility Flywheel

AIR3 is designed as the utility token linking product usage, access, and value flows across the ecosystem.

## Flywheel concept

AIR3 utility is tied to real product actions:
- access unlocking
- bot/community deployment
- sponsor visibility
- feature payments
- execution/reward logic
- buyback and burn behavior

The documentation principle is simple:
utility must come from product usage, not only narrative.

## Current / active utility directions

### Access and product gating
AIR3 is used to access or unlock product features across the AIR ecosystem.

### Community agent deployment (AIRTool)
Projects use a buy + burn flow to unlock AIR3 agent deployment for their own communities.

### Sponsor visibility (AIRSponsor)
Projects use a buy + burn flow to obtain live sponsor slots and scripted AIR3 call-outs.

### Future / broader service unlocks
AIR3 utility also extends to feature access, white-label capabilities, and partner services.

## AIRTrading connection

AIRTrading introduces a protocol-level value path:
- realized profit is split
- part is routed to buyback
- part is routed to users (AIR3 rewards side)

This connects protocol performance (when profitable) to token flows.

## Documentation note

Tokenomics, exact percentages, thresholds, durations, and campaign rules can evolve.
This docs set focuses on product utility architecture and flow logic.
