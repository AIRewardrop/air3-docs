## Launch Context (Moonshot / Moonit + Meteora)

AIR3 was launched through a Moonshot fair-launch flow (now Moonit), with liquidity routed into Meteora infrastructure.  
This launch model is relevant because it defines the initial market structure and the way early liquidity/fees are handled by the launch stack.

The Moonshot / Meteora launch model is documented publicly by Moonit and Meteora and can be consulted for the general mechanics of the launch venue.
