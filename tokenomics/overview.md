# Tokenomics Overview

AIR3 is the native token of the AIRewardrop ecosystem on Solana. Its tokenomics are designed to connect product activity, protocol economics, and ecosystem funding in a transparent way.

## Core Principles

### Fair Launch Foundation
AIR3 was launched as a fair launch token on Moonshot (now moon.it) on Solana, with an initial supply of `1,000,000,000 AIR3`.

### Product-Linked Utility
AIR3 utility is tied to real ecosystem usage across AIR3 products, including agent access models, sponsorship flows, and protocol-level buyback and reward mechanics.

### Transparent Verification
AIR3 token, wallet, and liquidity references are documented with public links to explorers, dashboards, and pools so users can verify key information directly.

### Sustainable Treasury Funding
The documentation describes an operating model where protocol activity, including AIRTrading performance flows, can contribute to ecosystem funding. In particular, the marketing treasury is intended to be supported by protocol economics rather than relying only on external capital inflows.
