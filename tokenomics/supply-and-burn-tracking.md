# Supply and Burn Tracking

## AIR3 token mint (CA)

- AIR3 token mint (contract address): `EMu7evjiKvpUutzCKYhPQNpTjeRdEmWZKKE3y6eWpP3q`

## Circulating supply tracking

Circulating supply changes over time due to market activity, custody distribution, and burn mechanics. The recommended public reference is:

- GeckoTerminal AIR3/SOL pool page (market cap and token price references)
- DexScreener market page
- Solana explorers and token dashboards as available

## Burn tracking

The AIR3 ecosystem uses public on-chain tracking for burn-related transparency.

- Solscan (burn tracking reference): https://solscan.io/account/2jvsWRkT17ofmv9pkW7ofqAFWSCNyJYdykJ7kPKbmoon

## Documentation policy for live metrics

Because burn totals and circulating metrics are continuously changing, this documentation keeps:
- the authoritative addresses
- the explorer links
- the methodology context

For dashboards and public-facing cards, current totals should be fetched live from the referenced sources rather than manually copied into static docs.
