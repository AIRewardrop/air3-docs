# Token Distribution

The initial distribution of AIR3 was executed on **Moonshot** using a **bonding curve** mechanism. This approach ensures a fair and transparent allocation of tokens, where prices increase progressively with demand.

#### Key Advantages:

* **Tax-Free Transactions:** No additional taxes on trades, ensuring cost efficiency for participants.
* **Equitable Distribution:** The bonding curve prevents token hoarding, promoting decentralization and reducing concentration risks.
* **Continuous Liquidity:** Participants can buy or sell at any time, maintaining liquidity without reliance on secondary markets.

This model fosters inclusivity and creates a balanced, dynamic pricing structure that supports long-term sustainability.

* **Total Supply**: 1 Billion $AIR3 tokens.
* **Circulating Supply**: \~980 Million on Solana after initial Meteora **LP burn**.
* **Developer Wallet**: Holds \~1.74% of total supply for ongoing development and partnerships.
